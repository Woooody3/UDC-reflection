How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A. The difference is where the bug might occur.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    A. History information helps debuging and tracing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A. Pros: you can save only the versions you want, makes it easier to trace back;
       Cons: might lose the data when accidents (run out ot electricity, etc.) occur.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A. No idea at this moment, sounds the Git's way might cause confusion.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    A. Don't know yet.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    A. if brakes happened, version control could return to normal easily by rolling back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A. up and download informations.
